## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Visit the [Photorealistic Prompt Generator](https://yourusername.github.io/photo-prompt-generator/) (replace with your actual GitHub Pages URL)

4. Copy the generated prompt with one click
5. Paste into your AI image generator of choice

Alternatively, you can:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. No build process or dependencies required!

## üí° How to Use

### Creating Prompts

1. **Subject**: Start with a clear description of your main subject
2. **Environment & Mood**: Describe the setting and emotional tone
3. **Composition & Framing**: Add details about camera angles and composition
4. **Lighting & Color**: Specify lighting conditions and color schemes
5. **Camera & Technical Specs**: Include camera models and technical details
6. **Style & Quality Keywords**: Add finishing touches on the overall style
7. **Negative Prompts**: Specify what you don't want in your image

### Tips for Best Results

- **Be Specific**: "A serene lake surrounded by autumn trees" works better than just "a lake"
- **Use Quality Keywords**: Terms like "photorealistic", "highly detailed" help achieve better quality
- **Balance Detail**: Too little detail gives generic results, too much can confuse the AI
- **Use Negative Prompts**: Effectively filter out unwanted elements like "cartoon, anime, illustration"
- **Save Good Presets**: When you find a combination that works well, save it for later use

## üîß Customization

The Photorealistic Prompt Generator is built with vanilla HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. You can easily customize it:

- **Add More Variations**: Extend the `variations` object in the JavaScript to add more options
- **Modify Default Negatives**: Change the `baseNegativePrompts` constant to match your preferences
- **Visual Styling**: Adjust the Tailwind classes or add custom CSS

## üíª Technical Details

- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Lightweight**: Fast loading with minimal overhead
- **Local Storage**: Saves presets to your browser's local storage
- **No Server Requirements**: Works completely client-side
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling via Tailwind CDN
- **Font Awesome**: Icons via Font Awesome CDN

## üìö Prompt Structure

The generator creates prompts in this format:

```
[Subject]; [Environment & Mood]; [Composition & Framing]; [Lighting & Color]; [Camera & Technical Specs]; [Style & Quality Keywords]
```

Negative prompts are kept separate as some AI platforms have dedicated negative prompt fields.
